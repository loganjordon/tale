Howdy, I'm Logan Jordon.

I am a Christian, a software developer, a writer, a computer science graduate from the University of Arkansas, and a lifetime student of God's Word. I reside in Northwest Arkansas with my wife of {{ yearsSince }}.{{ modulus }} years.

I write with the aim of increasing your knowledge of the Lord, and your desire to know Jesus Christ personally. Here you will find articles, anecdotes, and analyses of various topics I find interesting, ranging from systematic theology to living the daily Christian lifeâ€”plus the occasional YouTube video I think you should watch.
