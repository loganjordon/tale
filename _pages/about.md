Howdy, I'm Logan Jordon. I am a Christian, a Calvinist, a software developer, a writer, and a dungeon master. I was regenerated by the blood of Christ on August 3rd, 2008. I'm wanting to use this blog as a platform to share the great news of Jesus Christ with anyone who has access to the internet.

Here, you will find articles, stories, and scriptural and doctinal discussion. Let me know what you think by sending me a message on <a target="_blank" href="{{ site.author.twitter }}">Twitter</a>.
