I'm Logan Jordon. I'm a Christian, a software developer, a writer, a reader, and a dungeon master. I graduated from the University of Arkansas and earned a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I've been married to my beautiful wife, Sierra, since May of 2019.

This website is still fresh, as you can see, but I plan to fill it with many of my scribblings. If you have any questions about some of the things you read here, or would like to discuss the wonderful game of D&D, follow me on <a href="{{ site.author.twitter }}">Twitter</a>.
