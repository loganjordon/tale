## Who am I?
Howdy, I'm Logan Jordon. I am a Christian, a Calvinist, a software developer, a writer, and a dungeon master. I was regenerated by the blood of Christ on August 3rd, 2008. I'm wanting to use this blog as a platform to share the great news of Jesus Christ with anyone who has access to the internet.

## My Mission:
Are you sure you know what the Bible says? I thought I did. Join me in learning what the Bible _really_ says, and <a href="http://eepurl.com/heJUTb" target="_blank">subscribe</a> to get my latest posts in your inbox. On this site you will find articles, personal stories, and various scriptural and doctinal discussion, all written with the aim of increasing your knowledge of the Lord, and your desire to know him personally (John 3:30, Mark 8:34).
