## Who am I?
Howdy, I'm Logan Jordon. I am a Christian, a Calvinist, a <a href="https://www.fieldagent.net/" target="_blank">software developer</a>, a [writer]({{ site.base_url }}/), and a dungeon master. I was regenerated by the blood of Christ on August 3rd, 2008, and then rededicated my life on September 1st, 2020. I graduated from the University of Arkansas with a bachelor's degree in computer science in 2019.

## My Mission?
To write with the aim of increasing your knowledge of the Lord, and your desire to know him personally (John 3:30, Mark 8:34). Here you will find articles, anecdotes, and analyses of various topics. From theology to living the daily Christian life, it is my prayer that my writing would convict, challenge, and encourage you.
