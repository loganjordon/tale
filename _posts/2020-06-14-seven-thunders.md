**The following is a journal entry from February 7th of this year.**

I set aside an entire evening to write today, but my body opted to nap instead. I got extremely tired at lunch, and it only got worse the longer I was awake. I got home in the afternoon, read chapters 9 and 10 of Revelation, and then fell asleep on the couch. I woke up to what sounded like a car smashing into our trashcan outside. A boom and frightening roar, as if our trashcan had been hurled down the street, sliding and rolling on the pavement. I jumped awake, my heart pounding at the thunderclap. I told our Google Home to turn the lights off, hoping not to be seen when I peeked.

I peered through the curtain of our front window and didn't see anything out of the ordinary. Our trashcan was perfectly upright, unmoved by our mailbox. There was no half-exploded car in the street. It didn't seem right -- not after what I had just heard. I checked the driveway as well.

Nothing.

I peered out our bathroom window on the south side of our house to see if there was a wreck at the intersection we live next to. Nothing.

It was a strange, terrifying experience and I still don't understand what it was I heard. I truly have no idea.

I had just read Revelation 10:4 which talks about the seven thunders, and John is about to write down what the seven thunders has just said to him, but then the angel with one foot in the water and one foot on the land tells him to seal up what was said by not writing it down. I keep wondering if it has something to do with that. I mean, what a coincedence, you know?

> And when the seven thunders had sounded, I was about to write, but I heard a voice from heaven saying, “Seal up what the seven thunders have said, and do not write it down.” Revelation 10:4 (ESV)
