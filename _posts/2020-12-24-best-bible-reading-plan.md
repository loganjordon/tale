With the year coming to a close, I figured it was high time to let you guys know about the Bible reading plan I've been following. It is, without a doubt, the best Bible reading plan I've ever seen. It aims to have you read the Bible in a year, but unlike any other plan I've ever tried. We'll say it's my Christmas present to you.

## My past Bible-in-a-Year experience

I don't know about you, but I have never successfully read the whole Bible in a year. I would start a new reading plan, and in my mind I'd be pumped. I'd think, "Oh man, this is it! This is the year I actually do it." Then, before the week was over, I was behind on my daily reading, struggling to keep up, and eventually was back to my usual slow reading pace.

And that was a problem with most of the reading plans I had ever tried: it required a really fast pace. I don't know if you're like me, but I'm a slow reader—_especially_ of the Bible. It's not because I struggle reading in general, but because of my desire to really soak the text in my noggin. Imagine me screwing off my cranium, popping it open with a **THWOOP** sound, grabbing my silly putty brain and slinging it on the text, pressing it firmly onto what I want to remember, and peeling it back slowly. That is usually how it goes with any text I want to immerse myself in.

And that is exactly what I want to do with God's Word! No reading plan I had ever tried was able to satisfy that desire to savor and cherish the Scripture, while simultaneously keeping me on track to finish the entire Bible in a year.

That is, until I found the <a href="https://www.navigators.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Discipleship-Journal-Bible-Reading-Plan-9781617479083.pdf" target="_blank">**Discipleship Journal Bible Reading Plan**</a>.

And no, I'm not being paid to promote this (could you imagine). I'm honestly just really excited that I've found a plan that works for me.

## What makes it different?

### 1. It accounts for passages you should dwell on.

Remember how I told you that I'm a slow reader? One of the reasons I terry my way through the Bible with a fine-tooth comb is because I don't want to miss anything. What this reading plan does so well is that it assigns you smaller portions of Scripture here and there that you _ought_ to take your time on.

For example, on January 1, you would have these four readings:

* Matthew 1:1-17
* Acts 1:1-11
* Psalm 1
* Genesis 1-2

Only eleven verses in Acts; only seventeen verses in Matthew. Isn't that nice? This allows you to savor your way through the Bible, all while finishing it in a year. This is something I've never seen any other reading plan do.

### 2. It is systematic.

The <a href="https://www.navigators.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Discipleship-Journal-Bible-Reading-Plan-9781617479083.pdf" target="_blank">Discipleship Journal Bible Reading Plan</a> gives you two New Testament and two Old Testament readings each day.

This is a plus to any reading plan, honestly. A systematic reading of the Scripture is so incredibly important. Why? Because it gives you a better perspective on the meta-narrative of the Bible; that is, God's plan of [salvation through Jesus Christ](https://www.loganjordon.com/2020/11/i-invite-you). The more you read Scripture, the more you see that it is all pointing to Jesus of Nazareth. All of it.

And now, for my favorite feature of the reading plan...

### 3. If you're falling behind, fear not.

This is where the reading plan is really _really_ smart.

Of course we're going to have those days where we don't get all of our reading done. Maybe you were only able to read the 24th Psalm this morning, and not the rest of chapters 2 and 3 of Exodus. Maybe you woke up late.

Maybe... you just wish you had more time?

Well you're in luck.

With the <a href="https://www.navigators.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Discipleship-Journal-Bible-Reading-Plan-9781617479083.pdf" target="_blank">Discipleship Journal Bible Reading Plan</a>, you have **five days** to catch up at the end of each month. How awesome is that? It's a nice insurance plan to guarantee that you finish in a year.

## Are you going to give it try in 2021?

What do you think about it? Are you willing to give it a try? Even if you don't finish the entire plan in a year, it is still worth your time.

If you're hesitant, then remember this: your ole pal Logan will be reading the same passages you'll be reading each day, if you decide to adopt this plan. I fully expect to write another post in a year to tell you how I did—whether I succeeded or not. Ultimately, any day I get the privledge to open the Bible is a blessing in itself (John 17:17, 2 Timothy 3:16). I hope you'll join me.
