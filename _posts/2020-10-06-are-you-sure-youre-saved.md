I was in my underwear when I knocked on the door.

"Come in," said my parents.

I walked into their bedroom, tears in my eyes, and when they asked what was wrong I started to cry. I had just been baptized the previous Sunday, and at this very young age I thought that baptism was how you got saved. I knew something was wrong though, because the hole in my heart had not gone away.

I sniffled, "I think I need to be baptized again."

Looking back, it's funny that I would suggest that maybe the first baptism didn't work --- as if getting dunked again would fix my heart. It wouldn't be until a few years later that I'd learn that baptism is not equal to salvation. But let's think for a moment. What if I, from that day on, had called myself a Christian?

There's a word for someone who thinks their saved but isn't. They're called a **false convert**, and that's exactly what I would've been if I had settled for my false baptismal "conversion".

This begs the question: Reader, are you _sure_ you're saved? Do you have assurance in your mind of your salvation? Are you bearing fruit[^1] as evidence of your salvation? Are you sure you've made the decision to believe in Jesus as Lord, and repented of your sinful lifestyle? The Bible calls us to examine ourselves, and to confirm our election (2 Peter 1:10).

> 2 Corinthians 13:5 --- Examine yourselves, to see whether you are in the faith. Test yourselves. Or do you not realize this about yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you?—unless indeed you fail to meet the test! (ESV)

How do we examine ourselves though? What are some proofs of a truly regenerated person? Don't worry, like always the Bible has the answer. This was the entire reason 1st John was written.

Before we commence however, a little disclaimer: what you are about to read may seriously rock your world. Find a comfortable place, ideally alone, and read these questions to yourself. If you are saved, then your answers to **all** of the questions below should be "yes". If you can't answer "yes", there is a chance that you may not be saved.

I want to also express the possibility that some of you reading this may truly be saved yet your fruit might be lacking in this season of life. To those I say: Let this article fuel you! Repent of your wicked ways immediately by expressing disgust and remorse for your sin in prayer. Trust me, I know the Christian life is not easy, but that is no excuse to let sin rule in your life. Pray, and then pray some more. Christ frees us from sin, so if sin is your master, then you **need** to repent.

> Matthew 7:13–14 --- Enter by the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and the way is easy that leads to destruction, and those who enter by it are many. For the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and those who find it are few. (ESV)

Did you catch that? Those who find Jesus are "few". The fact is there will be some who read this who think they're saved, but are not. The Bible says _many_ people will come to Jesus on the day of judgement thinking they're going to Heaven, only to be turned around and told they were never a Christian in the first place.

> Matthew 7:22–23 --- On that day many will say to me, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?’ And then will I declare to them, ‘I **never** knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.’ (ESV)

Jesus didn't say that he knew the false convert for a while, and then they fell away. He says, "I **never** knew you." This should drive us to look at our hearts closely. Do we truly know Jesus as our savior? Here are the ten questions that every self-proclaiming Christian should ask themselves in order to confirm their salvation[^2].

## 1. Do you engage and enjoy fellowship?

> 1 John 1:7 --- But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin. (ESV)

Wiktionary puts the definition of fellowship as, "A company of people that share the same interest or aim." So, if we are truly saved, then we have fellowship with one another. Are you regularly engaging in fellowship? Do you gather with fellow believers and, not only sit and watch football, but share the aim of Christ with each other?

Todd Friel of <a href="https://wretched.org/" target="_blank">Wretched.org</a> says true Christian fellowship is "having Jesus Christ in the center of our conversation and our thoughts." Do you engage and enjoy Jesus being the center

1. FELLOWSHIP - we enjoy time with fellow believers than pagans. --- If we walk in the Light... (1 John 1:7)


## 2. Do you know that you're a sinner?

2. If think you have no sin, you are not saved. Period. Are you appalled by your sin? TOTAL DEPRAVITY --- If we say we have no sin... (1 John 1:8)

## 3. Do you keep God's commandments?

3. We keep his commandments? (1 John 2:3)
- Not just the TEN, but ALL?
- His commandments should not be burdensome! (1 John 5:3)
- Do you hate your brother? (2:9-11)
- Jesus commands that we love one another (John 13:34-35)
- Stop acting like you've heard all of this before. You need to hear this. You need to look at yourself today and **make sure** you are saved. This is so important.

## 4. Do you love Christ more than the world?

- (1 John 2:15)
- Charles Spurgeon, "Christ is not loved at all if not loved above all."
- Matthew 16:24–25

## 5. Do you believe that Jesus is the Son of God?

5. If you don't believe in Jesus "Anyone who denies the Son..." (1 John 2:23)
- Do you believe Jesus was truly God and truly Man? Do you affirm Christ's full deity and full humanity?
- Charles Spurgeon, "You cannot have faith and yet live in sin. To belive is to be holy."
- What does it mean to be holy? Paul Washer uses this analogy: cutting veggies and sliding the cut pieces away.

## 6. Are you longing for the return of Christ?

6. Are you longing for the return of Christ? (1 John 3:2)

## 7. Have your sinful habits stopped?

7. No one who is born of God practices sin... (1 John 3:9, 1 John 1:6) Christians _do_ sin, but they do not practice sin. They are **not** okay with sin.
- John Piper says, "The new born person doesn't read verse 9 of chapter 3 and blow it off."

## 8. Do you love fellow believers?

8. We love the brethern. We pray for each other, serve each other. No just out of obedience, but out of love. (1 John 3:14)
Quote by Todd Friel:
> Do you love fellow believers more than you love unbelieving family members?

## 9. Do you love reading the Bible?

9. "he who knows God listens to us."" (1 John 3:14) Do you love good preaching? Does it delight your heart?

## 10. Does God abide in you through the Holy Spirit?

10. Whoever confesses that Jesus is the son of God, God abides in him, and he in God. (1 John 4:15) Are you evangelizing? Are you embarrassed to evangelize? That's a bad sign.

Our salvation changes our desire. There will be those who read this who _are_ saved. If you read some of the things above, and felt convicted that's a great thing. If

**Footnotes:**

[^1]: What do I mean by "fruit"? Think of a fruit tree. If its roots are soaking up crystal clear water, then its going to produce the cleanest fruit possible. If its planted by a toxic waste dump, then its fruit will be nasty. The word "fruit" means anything produced by man's efforts. If you are saved, then your "fruit" will give glory to God (Matthew 7:17-20, John 15:8).

[^2]: Once again, here's the caveat: if some of these questions send you into freak-out mode, that may be evidence of your salvation. We all go through seasons of life --- up, down, back up, then down again --- but the aim is always upward. Inversely, if you can't answer 'yes' to some of these questions and it doesn't worry you, I would be very afraid. Lastly, if you answer 'no' to a lot of these questions and want to be saved, send me an [email](/contact)! I would love to help you find Christ today.
