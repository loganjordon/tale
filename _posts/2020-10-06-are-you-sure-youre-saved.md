* Am I communicating well to the reader? Does it feel like a conversation?
* Am I being stylistically consistent?

I was in my underwear when I knocked on my parents bedroom door.

"Come in," said my parents.

I walked in, tears in my eyes, and when they asked what was wrong I started to cry. I had just been baptized the previous Sunday, and at this very young age I thought that baptism was how you got saved. I knew something was wrong though, because the hole in my heart had not gone away.

I sniffled, "I think I need to be baptized again."

Looking back, it's funny that I would suggest that maybe the first baptism didn't work---as if getting dunked again would fix my heart. It wouldn't be until a few years later that I'd learn that baptism is not equal to salvation. But let's think for a moment. What if I, from that day on, had called myself a Christian?

There's a word for someone who thinks their saved but isn't. They're called a **false convert**, and that's exactly what I would've been if I had settled for my false baptismal "conversion".

This begs the question: Reader, are you _sure_ you're saved? Do you have assurance in your mind of your salvation? Are you bearing fruit[^1] as evidence of your salvation? Are you sure you've made the decision to believe in Jesus as Lord and repented of your sinful lifestyle? The Bible calls us to examine ourselves, and to confirm our election (2 Peter 1:10).

> 2 Corinthians 13:5 --- Examine yourselves, to see whether you are in the faith. Test yourselves. Or do you not realize this about yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you?—unless indeed you fail to meet the test! (ESV)

How do we examine ourselves though? What are some proofs of a truly regenerated person? Don't worry, like always the Bible has the answer. This was the entire reason 1st John was written.

Before we commence however, a little disclaimer: what you are about to read may seriously rock your world. Find a comfortable place, ideally alone, and read these questions to yourself. If you are saved, then your answers to **all** of the questions below should be "yes". If you can't answer "yes", there is a chance that you may not be saved.

I want to also express the possibility that some of you reading this may truly be saved yet your fruit might be lacking in this season of life. To those I say: Let this article fuel you! Repent of your wicked ways immediately by expressing disgust and remorse for your sin in prayer. Trust me, I know the Christian life is not easy, but that is no excuse to let sin rule in your life. Pray, and then pray some more. Christ frees us from sin, so if sin is your master, then you **need** to repent.

> Matthew 7:13–14 --- Enter by the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and the way is easy that leads to destruction, and those who enter by it are many. For the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and those who find it are few. (ESV)

Did you catch that? Those who find Jesus are "few". The fact is there will be some who read this who think they're saved, but are not. The Bible says _many_ people will come to Jesus on the day of judgement thinking they're going to Heaven, only to be turned around and told they were never a Christian in the first place.

> Matthew 7:22–23 --- On that day many will say to me, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?’ And then will I declare to them, ‘I **never** knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.’ (ESV)

Jesus didn't say that he knew the false convert for a while, and then they fell away. He says, "I **never** knew you." This should drive us to look at our hearts closely.

Here are the ten questions that every self-proclaiming Christian should ask themselves in order to confirm their salvation[^2].

## 1. Do you engage in fellowship?

> 1 John 1:7 --- But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin. (ESV)

Wiktionary puts the definition of fellowship as, "A company of people that share the same interest or aim." Todd Friel of <a href="https://wretched.org/" target="_blank">Wretched.org</a> says true Christian fellowship is "having Jesus Christ in the center of our conversation and our thoughts." That is to say, if we are truly saved, we are engaging in groups of like-minded folks to discuss our Christian beliefs. I would take this even further, saying we should _enjoy_ having fellowship with other believers. Jesus dispenses the most joy a human can attain, so why would we not enjoy discussing His Word with friends of the faith?

## 2. Do you know that you're a sinner?

> 1 John 1:8 --- If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. (ESV)

Do you think you're a good person? That may be one of the most harmful things a Christian can say about themselves. Do you want to know why?

Because you're not.

> Romans 5:12 --- Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because all sinned (ESV)
>

Have you ever told a lie? Have you ever looked at a person and had lustful thoughts? Have you ever stolen something?

If you answered yes to even one of those, you're a **sinner**. That means you've broken God's law. So what is the just and righteous punishment for someone who is found guilty of breaking God's law? The answer is eternal suffering in hell---forever and ever, never ceasing. Why? Because God is perfect, and he requires nothing less than perfection.

But we're not perfect. That's why God came to Earth in human form as Jesus Christ, to be the sustitutionary atonement for our sins. He became the ultimate sacrifice, which means if we believe in Him and repent of our sins, then we get to inherit eternal life with Him. That means we get to celebrate His glory forever and ever---never ceasing.

The true Christian understands this and knows they are not good enough alone. That is why they now live by faith, having died with Christ, and being filled with the Holy Spirit (Galatians 2:20, Romans 8:9-11). You have been delivered from your previous life---the old self killed, and the new self in Jesus.

## 3. Do you keep God's commandments?

> 1 John 2:3 --- And by this we know that we have come to know him, if we keep his commandments. (ESV)

If you are a true Christian, then you keep God's commandments---not just the big ten, but **all** of them. How?

Love the Lord with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength, and love your neighbor as yourself. "On these two commandments depend all the Law and the Prophets" (Matthew 22:37-40).

This isn't to say that you try working your way to Heaven, but rather, because of what Jesus did for you, you desire to keep his commandments. Since Jesus has credited his perfect life to you, you desire and *enjoy* following his commandments (Psalm 1:2). You cringe when you hear someone take the Lord's name in vain, and you would never dare do it yourself. You live generously and exude the fruit of the Spirit. We aren't burdened by his commandments whatsoever.

> 1 John 5:3 --- For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments. And his commandments are not burdensome. (ESV)

If we desire and enjoy following his commandments, why would they be a burden to us?

## 4. Do you love Christ more than the world?

> 1 John 2:15 --- Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. (ESV)

Charles Spurgeon said, "Christ is not loved at all if not loved above all."

Jesus must be our paramount affection. The Westminster Shorter Catechism says, "Man's chief end is to glorify God, and to enjoy him forever."

Jesus offers joy that is beyond anything this created world can offer. The Holy Spirit gives us joy that surpasses the enjoyment of video games. I used to play video games religiously, and quite honestly idolized them. Today I can say that I feel more honest joy reading the Bible than I ever felt playing GoldenEye 007 on the Nintendo 64. That short "joy" I got from video games couldn't bring me fulfillment like Christ does. But at that time, I didn't know it. I couldn't fathom enjoying something more.

C. S. Lewis understood this when he said:

> Our desires are not too strong, but **too weak**. We are half-hearted creatures, fooling about with drink and sex and ambition when infinite joy is offered us, like an ignorant child who wants to go on making mud pies in a slum because he cannot imagine what is meant by the offer of a holiday at the sea. We are far too easily pleased.

## 5. Do you believe that Jesus is the Son of God?

>1 John 2:23 --- No one who denies the Son has the Father. Whoever confesses the Son has the Father also. (ESV)

Jesus was not just a good man who walked closely with God. Jesus *was* God (John 1:14, Galatians 4:4). Jesus was truly God and truly Man. Full deity, full humanity. Let anyone who says otherwise be _anathema_.

> Galatians 1:9 --- As we have said before, so now I say again: If anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to the one you received, let him be accursed. (ESV)

The word "accursed" there is the Greek word _anathema_ (ἀνάθεμα), meaning that that person should be excommunicated from the church and given the disfavor of God.

How are you doing so far?

Good?

Not so good?

Let's take a deep breath...

A few more....

Okay, are you ready? Good.

These last five questions won't take you long, so here they are.

<br>

## 6. Are you longing for the return of Christ?

> 1 John 3:2 --- Beloved, we are God’s children now, and what we will be has not yet appeared; but we know that when he appears we shall be like him, because we shall see him as he is. (ESV)

Does it get more simple than this? If we love the Lord with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength, then why wouldn't we be excited for the day he comes to take us into his presence?

## 7. Have your sinful habits stopped?

> 1 John 3:9 --- No one born of God makes a practice of sinning, for God’s seed abides in him; and he cannot keep on sinning, because he has been born of God. (ESV)
>
> 1 John 1:6 --- If we say we have fellowship with him while we walk in darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth. (ESV)

No one who has been regenerated by God practices sin.

A Christian is not addicted to porn; a Christian is disgusted by it (1 Corinthians 6:9, 1 Thessalonians 4:3-4, Matthew 5:28).

A Christian doesn't cuss; a Christian thinks before they speak (Ephesians 4:29, Psalm 141:3).

This is not to say that Christians are sinless (see number 2 on this list). Christians do sin, but they do not *practice* sin. They are not making a habit out of sin---they hate sin, quite honestly. The true Christian would rather die than sin against God.

Charles Spurgeon said, "You cannot have faith and yet live in sin. To believe is to be holy."

## 8. Do you love fellow believers?

> 1 John 3:14 --- We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brothers. Whoever does not love abides in death. (ESV)

Do you love the believers you surround yourself with? Do you love them more than you love unbelieving family members?

## 9. Do you love reading the Bible?

> 1 John 4:6 --- We are from God. Whoever knows God listens to us; whoever is not from God does not listen to us. By this we know the Spirit of truth and the spirit of error. (ESV)

How can you claim to know God if you never commune with Him?

You may be thinking, "How would I commune with God?" The answer is reading His Word.

Maybe you could be using your mornings more wisely: Instead of sitting in silence the whole way to work, turn on the audio verison of the Bible (which is totally free) and listen to it.

## 10. Does God abide in you through the Holy Spirit?

> 1 John 4:15 --- Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God. (ESV)

Isn't that incredible? God abides in you if you're a true Christian. This does not mean that you have to speak in tongues, flail around your arms, and seize on the ground. Absolutely not. This also does not mean that you can only have the Holy Spirit if you ask for it, or if you're more anointed than others. This is just not true.

If you are a true Christian, you have 100% of the Holy Spirit in you and you are anointed. It allows you to understand the Bible.

Justin Peters says "Scripture teaches that if you are a Christian, you're anointed... It's not a feeling, it's not a buzz, it's not an experience. It's reality... There is no division of classes within Christianity..."

> 1 John 2:20 --- But you have been anointed by the Holy One, and you all have knowledge. (ESV)

## Recap Time

Here are the ten questions we just asked ourselves.

1. Do you enjoy fellowship?
2. Do you know that you're a sinner?
3. Do you keep God's commandments?
4. Do you love Christ more than the world?
5. Do you believe that Jesus is the Son of God?
6. Are you longing for the return of Christ?
7. Are you habitually sinning?
8. Do you love fellow believers?
9. Do you love reading the Bible?
10. Does God abide in your through the Holy Spirit?

Were you able to answer 'yes' to all of them? If so, great! You are a born again Christian.

If you couldn't answer 'yes', ask yourself why. Are you in a season of suffering right now? The Bible teaches about many great men of God that fell away at times. The Apostle Peter denied Jesus three times (Luke 22:61-62). King David committed adultry and murdered the woman's husband (2 Samuel 11, 12). These amazing followers of the Lord fell away.

But...

What did they have in common? They repented. They got down on their knees and wept, begged the Lord to forgive them of what they have done, and turned from the wicked ways.

Whether you're a Christian who has fallen away, or someone who has never been saved before, come to Jesus today. Right now. Go into a room alone, and repent. Ask for forgiveness, and you will receive it.

> Romans 10:13 --- For “everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.” (ESV)

**Footnotes:**

[^1]: What do I mean by "fruit"? Think of a fruit tree. If its roots are soaking up crystal clear water, then its going to produce the cleanest fruit possible. If its planted by a toxic waste dump, then its fruit will be nasty. The word "fruit" means anything produced by man's efforts. If you are saved, then your "fruit" will give glory to God (Matthew 7:17-20, John 15:8).

[^2]: Once again, here's the caveat: if some of these questions send you into freak-out mode, that may be evidence of your salvation. We all go through seasons of life---up, down, back up, then down again---but the aim is always upward. Inversely, if you can't answer 'yes' to some of these questions and it doesn't worry you, I would be very afraid. Lastly, if you answer 'no' to a lot of these questions and want to be saved, send me an [email](/contact)! I would love to help you find Christ today.
