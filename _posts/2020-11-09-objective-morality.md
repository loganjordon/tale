*Mention postmodernism*

I recently had a conversation with an atheist friend of mine.

The conversation centered around abortion, but quickly gave rise to deeper, philosophical questions. Questions like, what is considered morally good? Where do morals come from?

Without hesitation, I told him something like, "Morals come from a moral law. You can't have a moral law without a moral law giver—namely, God."

He didn't agree. But, of course, I didn't expect him to. Atheists supress the truth, and their entire anti-Christ religion is centered on supressing the ultimate truth: that God exists. So then, what *do* atheists believe as far as morality?

The answer, for many, is **moral relativism**.

People who believe moral relativism are those who say that what *you* think is true must be true for you, and what *they* think is true must be true for them.

This is complete illogical garbage.

One of the first laws you learn in philosophy is the law of noncontradiction (link). It's the prime rule for rationality. This is a rule that states that 'A' can't be 'A' and 'non-A' at the same time and in the same relationship. This means 2+2 can't equal 4 and 5—it either equals 4, 5, or neither, but it can't be all three. And that applies to everyone, for all time.

The same can be said for morality; things are either morally right or morally wrong. Morality is not subjective. What may seem morally permissible to a pedophile—like lusting for children—doesn't mean it is morally permissible just because the pedophile thinks so. Morality requires objectivity.

Better yet, truth requires objectivity, and I think that's something atheists and Christians should agree on.

For example, you don't stop at a red light because it is subjectively true to you that you're supposed to. You stop because red means stop, and the law has made that very clear. If we lived life believing our subjective impressions as truth, then what about someone with colorblindness?

"You can't go because the light is red," you say.

"Well that may be true for _you_. However, I perceive that the light is green, and green means go!" screams the colorblind relativist as he speeds away.

If you and the colorblind person were relativists, it would be your perogative to let the colorblind person run the red light. It would be (ironically) out of your "moral scope" to try to convince him or her otherwise. Imagine the harm that would cause. I use this illustration to show you the absolute absurdity of believing in the relativity of truth. Things are either true or not—and the same goes for morality.

Richard Dawkins, the arch-atheist of our generation, explains that he desires morals to be thought out, discussed, and argued. Sounds great, right? But what are we thinking, discussing, and arguing on the basis of? What is our basis for what is moral? Our thoughts? Our personal rationalities?

This desire to strike moral gold was exactly what we tried to do in my undergraduate ethics classes. We would discuss, by logical means no less, ways of decyphering what might be thought of as right or wrong outside of an objective moral law. The problem with this however was that not every secular view arrived at the same answers.

So then which one is the right one? The utilitarian worldview? The qualitative hedonist worldview? The eudaimonist worldview? This brings us to the main point.

In order for morality to be absolutely and objectively clear, it must be based a clear view of reality. And no one has a clearer view of reality than God.

A couple of quick questions for you:

* Have you ever told a lie?
* Have you ever stolen something, even if it was small?
* Have you ever looked at a woman, or man, with lust?

There's a 99.9% chance that you answered yes to all of those. So, let's do a quick assessment: if you answered yes to all of the questions above, then, by your own admission, you're a liar, a thief, and an adulterer (Matthew 5:28).

Why would I want someone like that to be responsible for my basis of morality? Even Jesus, during his earthly ministry, didn't entrust himself to mankind, because he knew how evil we are at heart (John 2:24-25).

The great news is that we don't have to rely on sinful people, like us, to discern what is right and wrong. God has taken care of that for all of us. Atheists believe that some how they are able to conjure up morality when, on the flip side, the conscience they possess is a God-given, society-shaped moral compass, on which God's moral law has been written. That is why when you were a child, you felt a pang of guilt when you lied to your mom—you know what I'm talking about. We are born knowing that murder is bad—because God's law is written on our heart. Atheists didn't come up with that.

(Romans 2:14-15)
