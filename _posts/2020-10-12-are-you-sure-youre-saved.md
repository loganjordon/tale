I was in my underwear when I knocked on my parents' bedroom door.

"Come in," they said.

I walked in, tears in my eyes, and when they asked what was wrong I started to cry. I had just been baptized the previous Sunday and, at this very young age, I thought that baptism was how you got saved. I knew something was wrong though because the hole in my heart had not gone away.

I sniffled, "I think I need to be baptized again."

Looking back, it's funny that I thought one more splash in the water would do the trick---as if getting dunked again would fix my heart. I would learn a few years later that baptism alone was not the answer. But let's think for a moment: what if I had shrugged my shoulders and called myself a Christian anyway?

There's a word for someone who thinks they're saved but isn't. They're called a **false convert**, and that's exactly what I would've been if I had settled for my false baptismal "conversion".

What about you? Are you _sure_ you're saved? Are you bearing fruit as evidence of your salvation? Even if you think you are saved, the Bible calls us to examine ourselves and to confirm our election (2 Corinthians 13:5, 2 Peter 1:10).

How do we examine ourselves though? What are some proofs of a truly regenerated person? Don't worry, like always, the Bible has the answer; this was the entire reason the book of 1st John was written.

Find a comfortable place, ideally alone, and read these questions to yourself. If you are saved, then your answers to **all** of the questions below should be "yes". If you can't answer "yes", there is a chance that you may not be saved.

I want to express the possibility that some of you reading this may truly be saved, but your fruit might be lacking in this season of life. If some of these questions send you into freak-out mode, that may be evidence of your salvation. We all go through seasons, but the aim is always upward. Trust me, I know the Christian life isn't easy, but that's no excuse to let sin rule over you. Pray, and then pray some more. Christ frees us from sin.

The sad fact is that there will be some who read this article who think they're saved, but aren't. Jesus said that those who find the way that leads to life are few (Matthew 7:13-14). The Bible says _many_ people will come to Jesus on the day of judgment, thinking they're going to Heaven, only to be turned around and told they were never a Christian in the first place (Matthew 7:22-23).

If you don't think you're saved, but want to be---send me an [email](/contact)! I would love to help you find Christ today.

Here are ten questions that every self-proclaiming Christian should ask themself to confirm their salvation.

<br>

## 1. Do you engage in fellowship?

> 1 John 1:7 --- But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin. (ESV)

Fellowship is, "A company of people that share the same interest or aim." Todd Friel of <a href="https://wretched.org/" target="_blank">Wretched.org</a> says true Christian fellowship is "having Jesus Christ in the center of our conversation and our thoughts." That is to say, if we are truly saved, we are engaged in groups of like-minded folks to discuss our Christian beliefs.

I would take this further, saying we should _enjoy_ having fellowship with other believers. Jesus dispenses the most joy a human being can obtain, so why would we not enjoy discussing his Word with friends of the faith?

## 2. Do you know that you're a sinner?

> 1 John 1:8 --- If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. (ESV)

Do you think you're a good person?

The truth is, you're not (Romans 5:12).

Have you ever told a lie? Have you ever looked at a person and had lustful thoughts? Have you ever stolen something?

If you answered yes to even one of those, you're a **sinner**. That means you've broken God's law. What is the just and righteous punishment for someone who's found guilty of breaking God's law? The answer is eternal suffering in hell---forever and ever, never ceasing. Why? Because God is perfect, and he requires nothing less than perfection.

But we're not perfect. That's why God came to Earth in human form as Jesus Christ, to be the substitutionary atonement for our sins. He became the ultimate sacrifice, which means if we believe in Him and repent of our sins, then we get to inherit eternal life with Him. That means we get to celebrate His glory forever and ever---never ceasing.

The true Christian understands this and knows they are not good enough on their own. That is why they now live by faith, having died with Christ, and being filled with the Holy Spirit (Galatians 2:20, Romans 8:9-11). You have been delivered from your previous life---the old self is dead, and the new self is in Jesus.

## 3. Do you keep God's commandments?

> 1 John 2:3 --- And by this we know that we have come to know him, if we keep his commandments. (ESV)

If you are a true Christian, then you keep God's commandments---not just the big ten, but **all** of them. How?

You love the Lord with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength; and you love your neighbor as yourself.

"On these two commandments depend all the Law and the Prophets" (Matthew 22:37-40). Since Jesus has credited his perfect life to you, you desire and *enjoy* following his commandments (Psalm 1:2).

You cringe when you hear someone take the Lord's name in vain, and you would never dare do it yourself. You live generously and exude the fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22-24). Plus, you aren't burdened by his commandments whatsoever (1 John 5:3). If we desire and enjoy following his commandments, why would they be a burden to us?

## 4. Do you love Christ more than the world?

> 1 John 2:15 --- Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. (ESV)

Jesus must be our paramount affection. Charles Spurgeon said, "Christ is not loved at all if not loved above all."

Jesus offers joy that is beyond anything this created world can offer. The Holy Spirit gives us joy---joy that surpasses the enjoyment of video games, amazon packages, and Tik Tok feeds.

C. S. Lewis understood this when he said:

> Our desires are not too strong, but **too weak**. We are half-hearted creatures, fooling about with drink and sex and ambition when infinite joy is offered us, like an ignorant child who wants to go on making mud pies in a slum because he cannot imagine what is meant by the offer of a holiday at the sea. We are far too easily pleased.

## 5. Do you believe that Jesus is the Son of God?

>1 John 2:23 --- No one who denies the Son has the Father. Whoever confesses the Son has the Father also. (ESV)

Jesus was not just a good man who walked closely with God. Jesus *was* God (John 1:14, Galatians 4:4). Jesus was truly God and truly Man. Full deity, full humanity. Let anyone who says otherwise be _anathema_ (Galatians 1:9)---let him be damned.

## 6. Are you longing for the return of Christ?

> 1 John 3:2 --- Beloved, we are God’s children now, and what we will be has not yet appeared; but we know that when he appears we shall be like him, because we shall see him as he is. (ESV)

Does it get more simple than this? If we love the Lord with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength, then why wouldn't we be excited for the day he comes to take us into his presence?

## 7. Have your sinful habits stopped?

> 1 John 3:9 --- No one born of God makes a practice of sinning, for God’s seed abides in him; and he cannot keep on sinning, because he has been born of God. (ESV)

No one who's been regenerated by God practices sin.

A Christian is not addicted to porn; a Christian is disgusted by it (1 Corinthians 6:9, 1 Thessalonians 4:3-4, Matthew 5:28).

A Christian doesn't cuss; a Christian thinks before they speak (Ephesians 4:29, Psalm 141:3).

This is not to say that Christians are sinless (see number 2 on this list). Christians do sin, but they do not *practice* sin. They are not making a habit out of sin---they hate sin, quite honestly.

Charles Spurgeon said, "You cannot have faith and yet live in sin. To believe is to be holy."

## 8. Do you love fellow believers?

> 1 John 3:14 --- We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brothers. Whoever does not love abides in death. (ESV)

Do you love the believers you surround yourself with? Do you love them more than you love unbelieving family members?

## 9. Do you love reading the Bible?

> 1 John 4:6 --- We are from God. Whoever knows God listens to us; whoever is not from God does not listen to us. By this we know the Spirit of truth and the spirit of error. (ESV)

How can you claim to know God if you never commune with Him?

You may be thinking, "How would I commune with God?"

The answer is reading His Word!

Maybe you could be using your mornings more wisely; instead of sitting in silence the whole way to work, turn on the audio version of the Bible (which is free) and listen to it.

## 10. Does God abide in you through the Holy Spirit?

> 1 John 4:15 --- Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God. (ESV)

God abides in you if you're a true Christian. This does not mean that you have to speak in tongues, flail around your arms, and seize on the ground. Absolutely not. This also does not mean that you can only have the Holy Spirit at church, or if you're more "anointed" than others.

If you are a true Christian, you have 100% of the Holy Spirit in you always, and you are anointed (1 John 2:20).

<a href="https://justinpeters.org/" target="_blank">Justin Peters</a> says "Scripture teaches that if you are a Christian, you're anointed... It's not a feeling, it's not a buzz, it's not an experience. It's a reality... There is no division of classes within Christianity..."

## How did you do?

1. Do you enjoy fellowship?
2. Do you know that you're a sinner?
3. Do you keep God's commandments?
4. Do you love Christ more than the world?
5. Do you believe that Jesus is the Son of God?
6. Are you longing for the return of Christ?
7. Are you habitually sinning?
8. Do you love fellow believers?
9. Do you love reading the Bible?
10. Does God abide in your through the Holy Spirit?

Were you able to answer "yes" to all of these questions? If so, great! You are a born again Christian.

If you couldn't answer "yes", ask yourself why. Are you in a season of suffering right now? The Bible teaches about many great men of God that fell away at times. The Apostle Peter denied Jesus three times (Luke 22:61-62). King David committed adultery and murdered the woman's husband (2 Samuel 11, 12). These amazing followers of the Lord fell away for a (short) season.

But, what did they have in common? They repented. They got down on their knees and wept, begged the Lord to forgive them for what they had done, and turned from the wicked ways.

Jesus told Peter, "but I have prayed for you that your faith may not fail" (Luke 22:32).

Whether you're a Christian who has fallen away or someone who has never been saved before, come to Jesus today. Right now. Go into a room, alone, and repent. Ask for forgiveness and you will receive it.
