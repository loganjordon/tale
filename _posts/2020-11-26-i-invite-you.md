## Happy Thanksgiving!

I hope this post finds you thankful for every breath and every beat of your heart. I hope you are celebrating with family—safely of course—but celebrating nonetheless. The fact that you can read these words with your eyes, process them in your brain, and understand them in an abstract manner is really something to thank God for. None of us deserve such sweet gifts, even as simple as the ability to read.

I've wanted to do this for a while. What you are going to read is my adaptation of an old tract written by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._C._Ryle" target="_blank">J.C. Ryle</a>, an English bishop from the 19th century.

If you don't consider yourself a Christian, or maybe you are considering Christianity, this post is written for you. If you think you are a Christian, but have been having doubts recently, this post is for you too. Feel free to print this out and give it to someone, or just copy [this link]({{ '#i-invite-you' | prepend: page.url }}) and share it anywhere you can.

# I Invite You

If you really want to be saved, I invite you to do so **today**. If you want to have peace with God, and glory in heaven after, I invite you to come to Christ right now.

I invite you today because of what Jesus says. He says: 

> "Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest." — Matthew 11:28 ESV

And:

> "All that the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never cast out." — John 6:37 ESV

Aren't you tired of your sins? Don't you feel the weight of them?

**I'm inviting you today to come to Christ!**

I might not know who you are, what you've done, or who you've been in the past, but I say to you right now: **Come to Christ** by faith and you'll be forgiven. Your status doesn't matter, your level of income doesn't matter, your age doesn't matter—you cannot be worse than the Apostle Paul before he was converted—come to Christ, and you'll be freely forgiven.

Don't you dare think, "Well, I've got to clean up my act before I make that decision." No no no. An idea like that is earth-minded; the Gospel bids you come _just as you are_.

Your idea may be to make peace with God first, and then come to Christ _after the fact_: the Gospel way is to receive peace from Christ _first of all_, and begin with him right where you are.

Your idea may be to try and turn over a new leaf, and attempt to work your way up to reconciliation and friendship with God: the Gospel way is first to be friends with God through Christ, and _then_ to work.

So come, willing to _receive_, and not thinking about how much you can _bring_. Come with your sins, and nothing other than a hearty desire for forgiveness, and you will be saved.

You may be thinking that you're not worthy of saving, that you're not good enough, that you may not be elect. My answer is this: you are a sinner and you're wanting to be saved, what more do you need? You are exactly who Jesus came to save. So come to him, today, right now, and you will have life.

## How do I "come to Christ"?

Repent and trust in Jesus, and you will be saved.

What is repentance? It is understanding you're a sinner, confessing your sins to God, and making a conscious choice to:

- Turn from sin (Luke 13:3, 5; 1 Thessalonians 1:9)
- Pursue Christ (Matthew 11:28-30; John 17:3)
- Obey Christ (1 John 2:3, John 14:15)

This means you need to pray. Go into a room alone, and take with you words of genuine repentance, and Christ will hear you.

Tell him that you've heard he receives sinners, and that you are one of them.

Tell him that you've heard he holds the keys of life in his hand, and ask him to let you in.

Tell him you come in full dependence on his own promises, and ask him to fulfill his word.

Do these things in simplicity and sincerity, and your prayer will not be in vain. Do these things, and you shall find him faithful to forgive your sins, and to cleanse you from all unrighteousness.

## I'm pretty sure I'm already born again

If you have any doubt, any doubt whatsoever, please don't dismiss it. If you think you've been saved, but aren't feeling the desires to turn from your sins, pursue Christ, and obey Christ, then there's a chance that you may _not_ be saved (also see [10 Questions for Self-Proclaiming Christians]({{ '/2020/10/are-you-sure-youre-saved#1-do-you-engage-in-fellowship' | prepend: site.baseurl }})).

Please don't stop reading. This is your **eternity** we're talking about. If you aren't sure in the slightest, then **come to Christ** today. It isn't too late.

## Don't wait any longer

Take what you've read here and act on it right now. No more sitting still or waiting for some imaginary feelings. **Come to Christ just as you are.**

Tell Jesus that you want to be saved, and ask him to save you. Do not rest until you have tasted for yourself that the Lord is gracious. Cast yourself wholly, and without reserve, on Christ and your soul will be saved.
