The video below is really meaningful to me. For years, I tried planning a life where I could retire young. What I thought of as a life well lived was getting rich quick off of an iPhone app, making money off of ads, and then never having to work again.

How sad would that have beenâ€”to be young, healthy, and saved by the hands of an almighty God through Christ, just to retire early and not work. What was I thinking?

I'm going to post this video here, in case someone needs to see it. One of my role models, <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnPiper" target="_blank">John Piper</a>.

## You Have One Life, Don't Waste It

As a Christian, it is my purpose to glorify God and enjoy Him forever. What sort of glory would I be bringing to Him if I was living on a beach somewhere, collecting seashells, sitting and watching TV, and plainly biding time until I died in my late eighties?

What difference would that sort of life make for the kingdom?

In the words of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Whitefield" target="_blank">George Whitefield</a>, "We are immortal until our work on earth is done." God, in his providence, is going to use me for His purposes, and in His time. Why *wouldn't* I travel to the depths of Africa to share the Gospel? Why *wouldn't* I ride in the back of a truck through thick jungle to reach a tribe of people with the good news of Jesus Christ?

God is in charge of my safety. God is going to feed me. And if it is God's will for me to die by disease, by a spear to the chest, or by old age, then may His will be done.

I am comforted in the fact that God has all control, and I have none.

Your homework is this: read Psalm 23, and then **memorize** it.
